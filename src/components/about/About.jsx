         <p>I'm a skilled programmer and web developer with over 2 years of experience in the industry. Throughout my career, I've honed my coding skills by solving more than 700+ problems on various coding platforms, including Codeforces, Leetcode, etc. I've also completed 5+ successful projects, which have enabled me to develop a deep understanding of web development best practices and project management.  <br />
         As a WordPress developer, I'm well-versed in building custom themes, plugins, and websites that are optimized for performance and user experience. <br />
         Whether I'm working on a new project or collaborating with a team, I'm committed to delivering high-quality work that exceeds expectations. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies, and I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web development.
